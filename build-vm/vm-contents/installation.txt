EvoSuite: Automatic Test Suite Generation for Java
Installation Steps:
1. For the demo on this VM we are using the command line version of the tool which is a jar file.
2. Since the source code of this tool is not made available by the author, recreating the jar on this VM is not possible.
Creating a jar out of the source is straight forward and could be done using export jar option in any popular IDE.
